Description (asked in Microsoft)
There are n*m people in a binary matrix. 1 indicates they have corona virus and 0 indicates they dont have corona virus at t=0.
At t = 1 , people having corona virus will spread the virus to its 4 neighbours (not the diagonal ones). At t = 2 the neighbours will spread further.
At what second all of the people will be having corona virus.

#3
Description (asked in Grab)
Given a binary matrix(containing only 0 and 1) of size n*m, such that each row in the matrix is sorted.
We need to find the row with max number of 0 along with count of 0s.
Difficulty - easy-medium
Sample
4 * 4 matrix
0 1 1 1
0 0 0 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 1 1
Ans -
Row = 2 (1 based indexing)
Count = 3
Explanation - 2nd row has max number of 0 and the count of max number of 0s is 3.

Description (Asked in Amazon)
Given a sorted array arr of distinct integers, return the lowest index i for which arr[ i ] = i. Return -1 if there is no such index.
For example, given the array [ - 4, -3, 2, 3 ], return 2 since arr[ 2 ] == 2. Even though arr[ 3 ] == 3, we return 2 since it's the lowest index.
Difficulty : Medium
Sample I/O
Input : [-5, -3, 2, 3]
Output : 2
Input : [-3, -2, -1, 0]
Output : -1

Asked in OLX interview (2 months ago )
Given an array of integer , find length of longest subsequence such that elements in subsequence are continuious integers
For example given the array [1, 9 ,3 ,10 , 4 ,20 ,2]
The answer is 4
Reason : 1,2,3,4 is longest consecutive subsequece although 9,10 is also consecutive subsequece of length 2 , but we have to print max length.
Difficult :average
Time complexity : O(n)

Description(Amazon)
There is a network of N router. every router is connected with every other router of the network through a direct link or via some other routers.
we want to identify the routers which would result in a disconnected network if they went down and add replicas of these router to the network.
write algo to identify all such router that needed to be connected to the network all the time.
INPUT:
numRouter: 7
numLinks: 7
links: [[1,2],[1,3][2,4],[3,4],[3,6],[6,7],[4,5]]
OUTPUT:
[3,4,6]

Description(Google)
There are N villages connected to each other via a pipe. You are given a matrix N*N matrix transferCost, where transferCost[i][j] represents the cost to transfer water from village i -> j(Cost of of i->j or j->i will be same). You are also given an array constructCost of size N where constructCost[i] represents cost to construct a well in village i. Any village which has well can supply water to itself with cost 0 and to other villages with cost of transfer. You need to find minimum cost such that each village gets water.
Difficulty - Medium
Sample:
N number of villages, N sized array representing cost of constructing wells, N*N matrix representing cost to transfer water via pipes.

3 7
2 0
0 2
Output:
5 (Construct well in village 1 and use pipe 1->2 to get water to village 2)

There are N people on instagram. You have given a boolean function f(x,y)
f(x,y) = true (if x follows y)
f(x,y) = false (if x doesnt follow y)
You have to find celebrity among these N people. A celebrity is -
1. who doesnt follow anyone.
2. Everyone else follows him.
Think input of your own.


#12 (Recently asked in Amazon phone interview)
You have an array of 0s & 1s such that 1 denotes a person sitting at that position & 0 is an empty place. You need to make m new people sit such that his maximum distance from the nearby 1s is minimum.
Example - 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 -> then for m = 1 new person should be made to sit at pos 3 in the array since - min(max(3, 3)) => 3 for all the 0s here.
